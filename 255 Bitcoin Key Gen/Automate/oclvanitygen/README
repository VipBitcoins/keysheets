This version of oclvanitygen has been specially built so it runs about 4
times as fast as the old version when using high-end AMD cards (7xxx or
greater). It is based on the version documented at
https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Vanitygen

We built this due to the frustration of trying to run oclvanitygen on a
Sapphire Radeon HD 7950 3GB and only getting 6 Mkey/s despite massively
overclocking the card. You can learn more at
https://github.com/samr7/vanitygen/issues/19

oclvanitygen will work with AMD Catalyst drivers 12.10 and earlier and
AMD Catalyst drivers 14.4 and greater.

To create compressed keys use the "-F compressed" option as in
oclvanitygen -F compressed -d 0 1Life or
vanitygen -F compressed 1Life

** NOTE THAT COMPRESSED KEYS ARE GENERATED ABOUT 15% FASTER THAN
NONCOMPRESSED KEYS SO WE RECOMMEND THAT YOU USE THEM **
(It's faster since it doesn't have to hash a second SHA-256 block.)

vanitygen64 is a 64-bit version of vanitygen. It runs about 50% faster
than the 32-bit version because vanitygen performs a lot of large
integer arithmetic.

oclvanitygen64 is a 64-bit version of oclvanitygen. It is just a little
bit faster but every bit counts!
